# 🛡️ MinIO Deployment – Simulated Government Analytics Customer

This project simulates a MinIO deployment for a government-sponsored threat intelligence team. It demonstrates how a Customer Engineer can support onboarding, automation, and feedback-driven iteration using open-source tools and cloud-native best practices.

## 👤 Simulated Customer Profile

- **Customer**: U.S. Department of Defense – Threat Intelligence Division  
- **Team**: Data Engineering Unit  
- **Use Case**: Scalable, secure object storage for analytics workloads (images, CSVs, logs)
- **Pain Points**:
  - Latency and cost issues with existing cloud object storage
  - No automation in onboarding new teams or buckets
  - Lack of visibility into data flow and usage
  - Complex permission management between data analysts and ML teams

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Simulate real-world onboarding of a new government customer
- Set up MinIO with scalable, S3-compatible object storage
- Automate bucket/user setup and simulate feedback loops
- Showcase observability and policy control

## ⚙️ Simulated Deployment Overview

> 💡 *Note: This project is structured as a simulation. It includes scripts and configuration files that represent what would be used in a real Kubernetes-based MinIO deployment.*

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- MinIO (S3-compatible object storage)
- Kubernetes (via Kind – Kubernetes in Docker)
- Helm (to deploy MinIO)
- MinIO Client (`mc`) for scripting
- Bash for onboarding automation
- Prometheus + Grafana (planned for monitoring)
- GitHub for version control and transparency
